            DEBT_COLLECTION_WITH_NON_PAYMENT_INSTALMENT - Registration of debt collection cases can be made in relation to private individuals if the debtor, within one month of legal action being taken, has not paid the claim, nor expressed that the claim is incorrect. Legal action will usually mean a submission of application for conciliation proceedings, application for writ of execution/attachment, or another type of petition. For enterprises, the same type of registration can be made one month after a payment request has been sent out. Of course, the same reservations regarding settlement and dispute also apply here.
            DEBT_COLLECTION - Registration of debt collection cases can be made in relation to private individuals if the debtor, within one month of legal action being taken, has not paid the claim, nor expressed that the claim is incorrect. Legal action will usually mean a submission of application for conciliation proceedings, application for writ of execution/attachment, or another type of petition. For enterprises, the same type of registration can be made one month after a payment request has been sent out. Of course, the same reservations regarding settlement and dispute also apply here.
            DEBT_COLLECTION_WITH_CONTINUATED_PROCEEDINGS - Registration of debt collection cases can be made in relation to private individuals if the debtor, within one month of legal action being taken, has not paid the claim, nor expressed that the claim is incorrect. Legal action will usually mean a submission of application for conciliation proceedings, application for writ of execution/attachment, or another type of petition. For enterprises, the same type of registration can be made one month after a payment request has been sent out. Of course, the same reservations regarding settlement and dispute also apply here.
            DEBT_COLLECTION_WITH_ACTIONS_FOR_COURT_PROCEEDINGS - Registration of debt collection cases can be made in relation to private individuals if the debtor, within one month of legal action being taken, has not paid the claim, nor expressed that the claim is incorrect. Legal action will usually mean a submission of application for conciliation proceedings, application for writ of execution/attachment, or another type of petition. For enterprises, the same type of registration can be made one month after a payment request has been sent out. Of course, the same reservations regarding settlement and dispute also apply here.
            SEIZURE - This is a form of temporary injunction which can be used before the creditor has obtained a judgement for its claim if there are grounds for fearing that ordinary enforcement will be forfeited or impeded to a significant extent. It is largely used in claims against Norwegian citizens residing abroad if the claim is contested.
            SEQUESTRATION - A time-limited reaction, in cases where there is a judgement that has not yet been enforced. Primarily this concerns disputed cases, and should not be overemphasized. Since the introduction of the new Enforcement Act, this form of reaction is very rarely used
            COURT_JUDGEMENT - A judgement has been rendered by the Conciliation Board. Debtor has either not appeared, or has otherwise expressed that the claim is correct.
            CHARGE_DECISION - To secure the payment of fines, repossession, court costs, reparations or redress, which has or is anticipated to be imposed on the accused, the court may, at the request of the prosecutor, impose an encumbrance for a determined sum on assets belonging to the accused, when there are grounds for fearing that enforcement will otherwise be forfeited or significantly impeded. Encumbrance can be imposed until the claim which is to be secured is final and legally binding. A decision by the court cannot be appealed.
            CHARGE_ON_PROPERTY - To secure the payment of fines, repossession, court costs, reparations or redress, which has or is anticipated to be imposed on the accused, the court may, at the request of the prosecutor, impose an encumbrance for a determined sum on assets belonging to the accused, when there are grounds for fearing that enforcement will otherwise be forfeited or significantly impeded. Encumbrance can be imposed until the claim which is to be secured is final and legally binding. A decision by the court cannot be appealed.
            BAN_ON_DISPOSAL_OF_ASSETS_PRIOR_TO_BANKRUPTCY - Debtor is declared bankrupt, and the bankruptcy court or court of justice has on its own initiative or at the request of a creditor, decided that the debtor's disposal of property which is encompassed by the right of seizure in the case of bankruptcy shall cease. This should be a result of the fact that the court found it likely that the debtor would otherwise dispose of the property to the detriment of the creditors.
            TEMPORARY_PRECAUTIONARY_MEASURE - A temporary reaction prior to an enforcement basis being available, which may be equivalent to an attachment, but which only applies when the claim is not a monetary claim.
            VOLUNTARY_DEBT_SETTLEMENT - After opening debt negotiations, debtor has been granted a voluntary/enforced debt settlement agreement. The duration of the settlement agreement is normally 5-7 years, and debtor shall be free of debt at the end of this period.
            DEBT_SETTLEMENTS_PROCEEDINGS - The Execution and Enforcement Commissioner has granted that the debtor can negotiate with all its creditors in order to, if possible, reach an agreement regarding a voluntary or enforced debt settlement agreement. The announcement of opening of debt negotiations is made in the Register of Mortgaged Movable Property and later followed up by a potential notification regarding an enforced or voluntary debt settlement agreement. However, most debt negotiations end without debt restructuring being implemented.
            COMPULSORY_DEBT_SETTLEMENT - After opening debt negotiations, debtor has been granted a voluntary/enforced debt settlement agreement. The duration of the settlement agreement is normally 5-7 years, and debtor shall be free of debt at the end of this period.
            NOTHING_FOR_DISTRAINT - This applies to payment requests that are processed by the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner, and when there is presently no possibility of wage garnishment, or judicial registration of lien on movable property or real estate. The petition is returned to the counsel of record as “Nothing to distrain upon”.
            DEBT_COLLECTION_WITH_DEDUCTION_IN_SALARY - In connection with an ongoing debt collection case, a fixed wage garnishment is established after the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner's processing of an application for writ of execution/attachment, with the stated amount as the fixed garnishment sum.
            DISTRAINT_ON_RENTAL_AGREEMENT - Involuntary lien of debtor's property or real estate. In civil claims, this is a continuation of a debt collection case in which the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner has completed execution proceedings on the basis of simplified treatment of an undisputed claim, or following a legally binding judgement or other enforcement basis.
            DEBT_COLLECTION_WITH_PERCENT_DEDUCTION_IN_SALARY - In connection with an ongoing debt collection case, a fixed wage garnishment is established after the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner's processing of an application for writ of execution/attachment, with the stated percentage as the fixed garnishment rate.
            DISTRAINT_1 - Involuntary lien of debtor's property or real estate. In civil claims, this is a continuation of a debt collection case in which the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner has completed execution proceedings on the basis of simplified treatment of an undisputed claim, or following a legally binding judgement or other enforcement basis.
            DISTRAINT_2 - Involuntary lien of debtor's property or real estate. In civil claims, this is a continuation of a debt collection case in which the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner has completed execution proceedings on the basis of simplified treatment of an undisputed claim, or following a legally binding judgement or other enforcement basis.
            DISTRAINT_3 - Involuntary lien of debtor's property or real estate. In civil claims, this is a continuation of a debt collection case in which the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner has completed execution proceedings on the basis of simplified treatment of an undisputed claim, or following a legally binding judgement or other enforcement basis. The same type of involuntary lien is also utilised by the state and municipalities to secure claims for charges such as taxes and value-added-tax. It is worth noting that mortgaging can be implemented to secure a claim where an appeal on the assessment has been submitted. If there are no other negative encumbrances in addition to claims from the municipality treasurer, this registration can therefore be afforded less weight.
            DISTRAINT_4 - Involuntary lien of debtor's property or real estate. In civil claims, this is a continuation of a debt collection case in which the Execution and Enforcement Commissioner has completed execution proceedings on the basis of simplified treatment of an undisputed claim, or following a legally binding judgement or other enforcement basis.
            COMPOSITION_APPROVED - A publicly announced debt settlement. This is very rarely used, as most businesses now avail themselves of the opportunity to initiate debt negotiations with their creditors without the need for a public announcement. The code can also be followed after a bankruptcy proceeding when there are sufficient funds in the bankruptcy estate so that also creditors who are not prioritised may be paid a dividend from a bankruptcy estate. After the payment, the estate will be relinquished to the debtor, and the operations may continue.

            SECURITY_IN_EQUIPMENT - Voluntary lien pledged as security for loans or credit in one or another form.
            MORTGAGE_IN_VALUE_OF_DEBT - This is a form of voluntary lien in which debtor's outstanding receivables are pledged as security for a loan, other provision of credit, or transferred to a factoring company as a part of a financing. In the latter case, the company “sells” its receivables, and receives a settlement for them in advance. This way they are covered against losses on claims, but must pay the factoring company a percentage of the nominal value of the receivable. However, most factoring agreements can be equated with other voluntary liens in which the creditor, in addition to, or instead of another type of security, gets the debtor's outstanding receivables as security.
            SECURITY_IN_FISHING_EQUIPMENT - Voluntary lien pledged as security for loans or credit in one or another form.
