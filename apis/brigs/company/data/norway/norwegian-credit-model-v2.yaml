            A convertible bond is a fixed-income debt security that yields interest payments, but can be converted into a predetermined number of common stock or equity shares.

            A bond (loan) is a fixed income instrument that represents a loan made by an investor to a borrower (typically corporate or governmental). A bond could be thought of as an I.O.U. between the lender and borrower that includes the details of the loan and its payments. Bonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually includes the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.

            "Long-term debt is debt that matures in more than one year. Long-term debt can be viewed from two perspectives: financial statement reporting by the issuer and financial investing. In financial statement reporting, companies must record long-term debt issuance and all of its associated payment obligations on its financial statements. On the flip side, investing in long-term debt includes putting money into debt investments with maturities of more than one year."

            Subordinated debt (loan) (also known as a subordinated debenture) is an unsecured loan or bond that ranks below other, more senior loans or securities with respect to claims on assets or earnings. Subordinated debentures are thus also known as junior securities. In the case of borrower default, creditors who own subordinated debt will not be paid out until after senior bondholders are paid in full.

            Restricted equity is equity that is bound to a limited company. Restricted equity may never be distributed to shareholders.

            Restricted equity is a security for other stakeholders (not shareholders) in a corporation such as lenders, suppliers, the state and employees. Restricted equity must exist since the shareholders never have to pay the debt in a bankruptcy. The shareholders in a limited company are free from liability in bankruptcy.

            Restricted equity includes share capital, revaluation reserves and other reserves
